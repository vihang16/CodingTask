We are writing software to collect and manage data on how fast racers can complete obstacle courses. An obstacle course is a series of difficult physical challenges (like walls, hurdles, and ponds) that a racer must go through.

Each course consists of multiple obstacles. The software stores how long it takes for racers to finish each obstacle, and provides useful statistics based on those times.

Definitions:
* A "run" is a particular attempt to complete an entire obstacle course
* A "run collection" is a group of runs on a particular course by the user.
* An "obstacle" is a portion of a course. We track how long it takes to finish each portion of the course

For example, here are some times for an obstacle course with four obstacles:

 Obstacles:    O1  O2  O3  O4
    Run 1:      3   4   5   6    (total: 18 seconds)
    Run 2:      4   4   4   5    (total: 17 seconds)
    Run 3:      4   5   4   6    (total: 19 seconds)
    Run 4:      5   5   3        (13 seconds, but run is incomplete)

All of these runs for one obstacle course (including the incomplete run) make up a run collection.
